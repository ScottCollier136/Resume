Hello. If you're here, you're likelly considering me for some job or employment.
This repo was made as a way to demonstrate basic coding ability.
It will mainly consist of basic coding tasks I find online used for hiring tests.
All code was written by me, with no assisstance from AI.

Q&A Section:

Q: Do you not have a personal project to show off?

A: There's two points to this. The first being that I dabble in several non-programming hobbies. The second being that if I were working on a big project, I wouldn't put the code on a public repo.


Q: Are the languages you code in here you main ones?

A: Sort-of. Professionally, I've mainly worked with Python and Java, but have dabbled in several others through schooling or work. The languages you see here are more because they are the most typical ones I see in job listings.


Q: Are you more of a frontend, backend, or full-stack developer?

A: I'd say full-stack leaning towards backend due to my experience. but I'm open to frontend.
